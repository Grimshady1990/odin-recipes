Introduction

This is my first project with Odin, and I will be creating a webpage using everything I have learned about HTML.

Conclusion

This project was fairly easy at its core, but the real challenge came with remembering to commit all my changes. I never would have thought that committing at such a frequent level was so important. With that said, I can confidently say that was the biggest lesson I learned in this project.

If you're reading this and have any advice on how Iâ€™ve handled my commits, your input would be much appreciated!
