    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I LOVE me some crispy pork belly, I mean, who doesn’t? But if you’ve ever tried to make the Chinese style crispy
        pork belly with the bubbly skin, you know it’s not a quick and easy thing. Even with my recipe, which is one of
        the simplest out there, it's a 2-day process.</p>

    <p>So THIS recipe, is much simpler. It's a Thai style fried pork belly that is unbelievably good, and it's only
        going to take you 30 minutes. I made this for a Thai friend, and after one bite and he said, "You need to sell
        this!" It was THAT good!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Pork Belly</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Ground white pepper</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Pat the pork belly dry as much as possible with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Cut the pork into 1-inch wide strips, and then cut each strip into pieces about ¾-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place the pork into a large mixing bowl and add the fish sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Use your hand to
            massage the pork and mix all the seasonings.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and the cornstarch and mix well. Sprinkle the flour mixture
            over the pork and mix well, making sure none of the pieces are sticking together.</li>
        <li>Add at least 1 inch of frying oil to a wok or a medium pot and heat it to 350°F (175°C) for the first fry.
        </li>
        <li>First Fry: Add half of the pork, placing it in the hot oil one piece at a time to ensure they are not
            sticking together. Fry for 2 minutes (time this). </li>
        <li>Remove the pork promptly and place on a plate to cool until it’s no more than lukewarm before frying them a
            second time.</li>
        <li>Second Fry: Once the pork is cool, bring the oil temp up to 385°F(196°C) over high heat. Add the pork all at
            once and fry for 70-90 seconds, or until the exterior is a deep golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the pork to cool for a few minutes before digging in as the fatty part of the pork is VERY hot out of the fryer!!</li>
    </ol>
