    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I LOVE me some crispy pork belly, I mean, who doesn’t? But if you’ve ever tried to make the Chinese style crispy
        pork belly with the bubbly skin, you know it’s not a quick and easy thing. Even with my recipe, which is one of
        the simplest out there, it's a 2-day process.</p>

    <p>So THIS recipe, is much simpler. It's a Thai style fried pork belly that is unbelievably good, and it's only
        going to take you 30 minutes. I made this for a Thai friend, and after one bite and he said, "You need to sell
        this!" It was THAT good!</p>
